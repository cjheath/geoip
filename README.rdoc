== DESCRIPTION:

GeoIP searches a GeoIP database for a given host or IP address, and
returns information about the country where the IP address is allocated,
and the city, ISP and other information, if you have that database version.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Includes support for ASN data files, thanks to Roland Matiz.
This release adds support for timezone names, thanks to Tonni Aagesen.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'geoip'
  GeoIP.new('GeoLiteCity.dat').country('www.atlantis.sk')
  => ["www.atlantis.sk", "217.67.18.26", "SK", "SVK", "Slovakia", "EU", "02", "Bratislava", "", 48.15, 17.1167, nil, nil, "Europe/Bratislava"]

  Returned values are the requested hostname, the IP address as a dotted quad,
  Maxmind's country code, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code,
  the ISO 3166 country name, and the continent code.

  GeoIP.new('GeoCity.dat').city('github.com')
  => ["github.com", "207.97.227.239", "US", "USA", "United States", "NA", "CA", "San Francisco", "94110", 37.7484, -122.4156, 807, 415, "America/Los_Angeles"]

  Returned values are the country values followed by region or state name,
  city name, postal_code/zipcode, latitude, longitude, USA DMA code, USA area code,
  timezone name. Sorry it's not a Hash... historical.

  GeoIP.new('GeoIPASNum.dat').asn("www.fsb.ru")
  => ["AS8342", "RTComm.RU Autonomous System"]

== REQUIREMENTS:

You need at least the free GeoLiteCity.dat, for which the last known download
location is <http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz>,
or the city database from <http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity>.

The ASN database location is
<http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/asnum/GeoIPASNum.dat.gz>.

This API requires the file to be decompressed for searching. Other versions
of this database are available for purchase which contain more detailed
information, but this information is not returned by this implementation.
See www.maxmind.com for more information.

sudo gem install geoip
